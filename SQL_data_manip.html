								<h2>SQL Database Management and Data Manipulation</h2>
								<p>There are multiple instances of code through this showcase. Each iteration of the code will be broken down and digested. To start
									I used SQL Server 2022 to create a database on my device. Secondly, I installed SQL Server Management Studio to access the database
									and manipulate the data. The dataset used is COVID-19 data obtained from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">
										https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus</a>. This dataset was then imported onto my database in two digestable tables, <i>CovidDeaths</i> 
										and <i>Covid Vaccinations</i>.

									<h3>Initial Overarching Data Check</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><pre>
SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 3,4</pre></span></p>
								<p>For the first step in this code I had to select all columns from the 'CovidDeaths' table, and re-order the 
									columns to have the country in the first column. I will explain each step of the code below:</p>
								<p><i>SELECT *</i>: This part of the code is specifying the columns to be retrieved in the result set. The 
									asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents all columns. So, the query is selecting all columns
									 from the "CovidDeaths" table.</p>
								<p><i>FROM portfolioProject...CovidDeaths</i>: This part of the code specifies the source of the data. It indicates that the data is retrieved 
									from the "CovidDeaths" table, which is located in the "PortfolioProject" schema. The ".." notation is used to separate 
									the schema and table names.</p>
								<p><i>ORDER BY 3,4</i>: This part of the code is used to sort the result set. The numbers 3 and 4 refer to the positions of columns 
									in the result set (based on the order in which they appear in the SELECT statement). In SQL, the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the 
									result set based on one or more columns. In this case, the result set will be sorted primarily by the third column and then by the 
									fourth column.</p>

									<h3>Checking data more granularly</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><pre>
SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, new_cases
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1,2</pre></span></p>
								<p>The second step is investigating the data more granularly by investigating specific columns. Note the only difference
									in this code is the addition of specific column names and the ordering of the columns from 3,4 to 1,2.</p>
								</section>

									<h3>Manipulate the data to show the percentage of deaths for the UK</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><pre>
SELECT location, date, population, total_deaths, (total_deaths/population)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE location like '%kingdom%'
ORDER BY 1,2</pre></span></p>
