								<h2>Qualified Business Analyst</h2>

									<h3 class="major">Modelling Business Processes</h3>
									<p>Within the Modelling Business Processes Module I learned how to model business processes using Use Case Diagrams and Activity Diagrams.
										This module has helped me put names to processes I already picked up previously! I have modelled business processes in order to
										offshore processes with HSBC and I have model processes in my current role in order to make them more pragmatic and streamlined.

									<section>
									<h3 class="major">Requirements Engineering</h3>
									<p>Within the Requirements Engineering module I learned to elicit, document, and manage requirements.
										This is heavily used in my current role to elicit requirements for my project from key stakeholders who may or may not know they 
										hold the knowledge. Meetings and interviews to elicit requirements, followed by documenting them, and managing them are 
										a regular part of my day to day role</p>

									<section>
									<h3 class="major">Organisational Behaviour</h3>
									<p>This module allowed me to see the organisational structure of a business, a fundamental aspect for
										a business analyst. Without understanding the business, you cannot implement change, seek requirements from
										the appropriate places, or consider a proper stakeholder analysis.</p>

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Business Analysis Practice</h3>
										<p>This module allowed a more hands on experience of Business Analysis. Making you attempt tasks
											that a business analyst has to do daily. Such as develop a BAM model, create use cases, and use
											requirements. This is a summarisation of all that I learned on the course and has been instrumental
											to my professional success.</p>

									<section>
										<h3 class="major">Conclusion and Future</h3>
										<p>Although this is a neat listing of my skills as a business analyst. There is so much more
											I have to offer. I have an insight and an ability to think outside the box and also have
											the intellectual capability to learn quickly. </p>
										<p>For the future I intend on sitting the final exam and attend an interview in order
											to cement my qualifications and also gain the BCS International Diploma in Business Analysis.</p>								</p>
